# An Adaptive Collocation Point Strategy For Physics Informed Neural Networks via the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method

This repository implements the following collocation point selection strategies:
* Uniform random (non-adaptive)
* [https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/19M1274067](Greedy)
* [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782522006260](Distribution-based)
* QR-DEIM (ours)
