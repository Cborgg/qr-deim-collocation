# An Adaptive Collocation Point Strategy For Physics Informed Neural Networks via the QR Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method

This repository implements the following collocation point selection strategies:
* Uniform random (non-adaptive)
* [Greedy](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/19M1274067)
* [Distribution-based](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782522006260)
* QR-DEIM (ours)
